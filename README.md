  🚀 The Epic Story of MrBeast 🌍
</header>

<section>
  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 1: Humble Beginnings</h2>
    <p>
      MrBeast, aka <span class="highlight">Jimmy Donaldson</span>, was born in 1998 and started his YouTube journey in 2012 at just 13 years old. Back then, he uploaded videos like Let’s Plays and ranking “worst YouTube intros.” Though he started small, he was deeply curious — constantly studying YouTube’s algorithm, experimenting with ideas, and dreaming big.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 2: Going Viral the Hard Way</h2>
    <p>
      In 2017, Jimmy blew up with a bizarre but brilliant video — counting from 1 to 100,000 non-stop. It took him 40 hours, and people couldn’t believe his dedication. That video marked the beginning of something massive. He leaned into unusual, time-consuming challenges like saying “Logan Paul” 100,000 times, or watching paint dry — and it worked.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 3: MrBeast the Generous</h2>
    <p>
      Jimmy didn’t just want views — he wanted to <span class="highlight">change lives</span>. He began giving away thousands of dollars to strangers, friends, delivery guys, and even random Twitch streamers. His motto became: “Give away more than I make.” Whether it was $10,000 in tips, a house, or a car — MrBeast made kindness go viral.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 4: Building an Empire</h2>
    <p>
      He kept reinvesting everything into bigger videos. Before long, he was giving away millions. He launched <span class="highlight">MrBeast Burger</span>, created his own chocolate bar brand <span class="highlight">Feastables</span>, and started a team to help him scale up. He even built a real-life Willy Wonka factory and recreated Squid Game with a $456,000 prize!
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 5: Changing the World</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond entertainment, Jimmy tackled global problems. With <span class="highlight">#TeamTrees</span>, he helped plant over 20 million trees. Then came <span class="highlight">#TeamSeas</span> — removing 30+ million pounds of ocean trash. He also launched <strong>Beast Philanthropy</strong>, a channel dedicated to helping people in need, with all proceeds going to charity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 6: Legacy in the Making</h2>
    <p>
      Today, with over <span class="highlight">200 million subscribers</span> and billions of views, MrBeast is not just a YouTuber — he’s a symbol of creative generosity. From a teen with a camera to one of the most impactful creators on Earth, Jimmy's story proves that you don’t need to be born rich to give back. All you need is a big heart and a bigger vision.
