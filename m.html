  🚀 The Incredible Journey of MrBeast 🎬
</header>

<section>
  <p><span class="highlight">MrBeast</span>, whose real name is <strong>Jimmy Donaldson</strong>, is one of YouTube's biggest stars 🌟. He started his journey back in <span class="highlight">2012</span> by posting random videos—like worst intros on YouTube and gaming clips. Little did the world know, this guy would become a legend!</p>

  <div class="fun-fact">
    🎮 Fun Fact: His first viral video counted from 1 to 100,000! (It took 40 hours 😲)
  </div>

  <p>As time went on, Jimmy realized that he wanted to make content that no one else dared to do. So, he started doing crazy, generous challenges like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Giving away <span class="highlight">$10,000</span> to a homeless man 💰</li>
    <li>Buying everything in a store 🛒</li>
    <li>Donating millions to streamers & friends 🎁</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="fun-fact">
    💡 Did you know? MrBeast once gave a house to a stranger on the street!
  </div>

  <p>His videos are now known for being over-the-top, full of heart, and insanely entertaining. He built a whole team, launched <span class="highlight">Beast Philanthropy</span> to help communities, created <span class="highlight">Feastables</span> (his own chocolate bar 🍫), and even started <span class="highlight">MrBeast Burger</span>! 🍔</p>

  <p>But it’s not just about the money. MrBeast wants to inspire creators to <strong>give more, do more, and change the world</strong>.</p>

  <div class="fun-fact">
    🌎 He’s also planting <strong>millions of trees</strong> and cleaning up oceans through #TeamTrees and #TeamSeas!
  </div>

  <p>From a small-town kid with a dream, to one of the <span class="highlight">most generous internet legends</span> ever—MrBeast's journey proves that kindness and creativity really can change the world. 🌟</p>
